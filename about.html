    <h5 class="mt-0">Karla Bear</h5>
   Karla Bear is your typical Aussie, blonde bombshell... think Kylie Minogue, but with height. Originally born in the most recent cast of KINKY BOOTS- The Musical, this 7ft live singing and dancing Glamazon has legs for DAYS and a vocal range to match.
In her muggle form, she has been seen all around the world in Kinky Boots, Priscilla Queen of the Desert and WICKED and, in 2019, she won Drag Idol UK- a National Drag competition giving her the chance to tour the country performing in the most prestigious LGBTI+ venues the UK has to offer.
Belting out anything from Musical Theatre to Top of the Pops, Whitney Houston to Ariana, and everything in-between, the focus isn't all Karla will be stealing... LOCK UP YOUR HUSBANDS!
